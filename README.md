* Reverse Engineering
* Binary Exploitation
* Web Exploitation
* Computer Forensics
* Coding/Scripting
* Miscellaneous
* University Courses (TBD)

### Crypto
1. OTP XOR - User enters input and output gets encrypted with flag.
2. Columnar Transpostion - User enters input and output gets encrypted with transposition cipher. The key can be guessed by entering variable lengths.
3. AES-ECB Oracle
4. AES-CBC Padding Oracle
5. Turnip Prices - Animal Crossing themed chal using popular game mechanic turnip prices. Prices will be hashed and user will need to reverse all hashes to determine the highest selling price. (WIP)
6. Mail - Animal Crossing themed chal using Assymetric Encryption. (WIP)
7. MSB Steganography - Same as LSB but with a custom script. No online tools to do it automatically.
8. Pixel Stego - encrypting image with another image. (WIP)

### Coding/Scripting
1. Baseball - Challenge will encrypt flag in base64, base16, base8, and base2. The user will have to run through all bases before time runs out.
2. Arithmetic - Multiple arithmetic challenges which will read "4 plus 5" to be solved before time runs out.

### Misc
2. Time Travel - Animal Crossing Themed Challenge. Go Back in time to get the best turnip prices.

### Idea Dump
* Base64 Wormhole
* Bash Scripting (Zip Files)
* Reverse Hexdumps
* Ciphers
* Prime Numbers
* Base Conversions
