Receive order json.
Generate new json (API) to send to Tom Nook

The Able Sisters are releasing their online shopping App for the Nook Phone!
Timmy and Tommy coded the mobile app and left it vulnerable to web injects
Hackers are using this to modify the item prices and generate sha256 receipts
with a fraudulent order total. This could pose unprecedented losses in Bells for 
the Able Sisters.
Your job is to detect if the sha256 receipt received from the API is well constructed
and to Nook for shipping.
